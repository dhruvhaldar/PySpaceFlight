**Learning:** Default 'y' (yellow) in matplotlib is nearly invisible on white backgrounds, a common issue in scientific visualization.
**Action:** Always replace 'y' with 'tab:orange' or '#FFA500' to ensure high contrast and readability.

**Action:** Always prioritize human-readable labels over variable names in user-facing output.
